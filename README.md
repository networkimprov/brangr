## Brangr - *Br*owse *An*y *Gr*aph

Brangr is a simple, unique tool that any website can host 
to provide a user-friendly browser/viewer for any GraphQL service (or many).

Brangr formats GraphQL results attractively, via a selection of user-configurable layouts.
It lets users extract the generated HTML, and its source JSON.
It provides a schema browser.
It has built-in docs.

Brangr enables sites hosting it to present users with 
a collection of pre-fab GraphQL requests, which they can edit if desired, 
and let them create their own requests.
And it allows sites to define custom CSS styling for all aspects of the formatted results.

It's fast &amp; small.[<img alt="Public Brangr site" width="48%" hspace="3" align="right"

It's a browser-based app, not a code module (although that might be arranged).
It's built with Vue.js, in ordinary Javascript & plain CSS, 
and employs the GraphQL.js language module&nbsp;[1].
It's tested on Firefox, Safari, and Chrome.

More features are on the drawing board &mdash; please convey what your GraphQL users need!

### Example

```
query {
  heroes(_layout:{type:table}) { # _layout arg not sent to service
    first
    last
  }
}
```
Brangr renders the above query as roughly this HTML (though not in a quote block):
>heroes...
>| First  | Last |
>| ---    | ---  |
>| Arthur | Dent |
>| Ford   | Prefect |
>| Zaphod | Beeblebrox |
